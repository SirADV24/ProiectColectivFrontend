Proiect colectiv - frontend


Setup:
- run npm install -g @angular/cli for angular client
- run npm-install for node modules ( node module will never be pushed on git because it's way to large )
- run the app with npm start or ng-serve
- run ng g c when creating component

Dependencies:
- if you need another package ( npm intall packageName ) added it to package.json and run npm install again
-> this way when we clone the changes to another computer, the user only has to run npm install
