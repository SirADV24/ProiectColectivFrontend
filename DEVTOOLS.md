Setup: <br />
    - run `npm install -g @angular/cli` for angular client <br />
    - run `npm-install` for node modules ( node module will never be pushed on git because it's way to large ) <br />
    - run the app with `npm start` or `ng-serve` <br />
    - run `ng g c` when creating component <br />
<br />
Dependencies:<br />
    - if you need another package ( npm intall packageName ) added it to package.json and run npm install again<br />
        -> this way when we clone the changes to another computer, the user only has to run npm install<br />
